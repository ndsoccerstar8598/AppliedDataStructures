root
	binary tree can have up to 2 children
	no longer continous block of memory but can now be pointers
	can use trees as built in binary search meaning find data in logn time
	Can also represent equations as binary trees
	2*x + y/2 as an example for one
	Red Black Tree are nasty algorithim but help fix n^2 problem of tree root-children
	Trie tree (each node has 26 children and can be used to find if word exists), only thing matters is length of word
	Althought Trie is very expensive in memory as opposed to Hashing but useful for finding words that start with a certain word
