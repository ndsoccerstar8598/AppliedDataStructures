-Adding Matrix
-Multiplying Matrix
  m*n * n*p = m*p

-Strassen Multiplying: be able to analyze time complexity of the algorithms given

-Row Reduction: Be able to know how to write the loops
  O(n^3)

-LU Factorization

-Inverse Matrix: A*A^-1=Identity Matrix

-Gram Schmidt: Have to make sure vectors are orthogonal
  O(n^3)

-Least Squares: When the data is overdetermined: too many equations
  O(n^2)
  A^TAx=A^TB

  mxn * nx1
  Ax = O(mn)

  A^T = O(mn)

  nxm * mxn = nxn   O(nmn)=O(mn^2)

  nxn * n
  Ax = O(n^2)
